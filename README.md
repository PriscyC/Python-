# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE RETAIL STRATEGY DATASET
This file outlines a response to the data insights and strategy task using Python.
This analysis focuses on merging two key datasets: "Transaction Data" and "Purchase Behavior Data" to provide deeper insights into customer purchasing patterns and behaviors. By combining transaction details with customer demographics, the goal is to better understand how different customer segments interact with products and to identify trends that can help improve business performance. The insights derived from this analysis provide actionable recommendations to drive growth and improveÂ efficiency.
