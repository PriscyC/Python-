# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE RETAIL STRATEGY DATASET
This file outlines a response to the data insights and strategy task using Python.
This analysis focuses on merging two key datasets: "Transaction Data" and "Purchase Behavior Data" to provide deeper insights into customer purchasing patterns and behaviors. By combining transaction details with customer demographics, the goal is to better understand how different customer segments interact with products and to identify trends that can help improve business performance.

# AKWA-IBOM STATE 2023 ELECTION OUTLIER POLLING UNITS DETECTION USING GEOSPATIAL DATA
ThIS dataset in this repository captures the analysis of Akwa-Ibom State 2023 election with the aim of detecting outlier polling units, where the votes received by parties showed significant deviation from those of neighbouring polling units, suggesting irregularities in the process.
Geographical Data: The first dataset includes the state, LGA, ward, and polling unit names, along with their precise latitude and longitude coordinates. This can help in mapping the locations and understanding the spatial distribution of the polling units.
Election Data: The second dataset provides detailed election results, including the number of accredited voters, registered voters, and the vote counts for major parties (APC, LP, PDP, and NNPP). It also highlights whether result sheets were stamped, corrected, or invalid, indicating potential issues in the electoral process.
